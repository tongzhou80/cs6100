    <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      This course provides hands-on software engineering experience through a practical Gomoku project and covers essential concepts like object-oriented design, code quality, testing, software development processes etc.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Class Participation</h2>
    <p>Students are expected to attend lectures, contribute to team project work, and participate actively in discussions. Regular attendance and communication with teammates is essential to project success.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Team Project</h2>
    <p>Throughout the semester, students will collaboratively build an online version of the Gomoku game. The project includes stages such as requirements definition, design documentation, implementation (frontend and backend), and testing. The project serves as a practical foundation to apply course concepts.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>There will be several individual and team-based assignments, including requirements documentation, design plans, testing exercises, and implementation tasks. Assignments are designed to reinforce lecture topics and guide the project’s development.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
    <p>You are expected to follow Fordham's academic integrity policies. Collaborative work is allowed on the team project, but all contributions should be original, and you must not copy from external sources or other teams. Violations will be treated seriously. See <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/academics/handbooks__publicati/undergraduate_academ/index.asp">Fordham's Undergraduate Policy on Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Exams</h2>
    <p>There will be a midterm and a final exam covering key technical and conceptual material from lectures and readings. Exams will include short answers, design questions, and conceptual application of techniques discussed in class.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conflicts & Accommodations</h2>
    <p>Please let the instructor know as early as possible if you face conflicts due to illness, religious holidays, or other circumstances. Reasonable accommodations will be made with timely notice.</p>
